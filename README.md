This project is an application management application that allows users to register, create, edit and eliminate courses, as well as book courses for their students.

The project is made with JavaScript and is based on the architecture of SPA (Single Page Application), which means that each page is loaded in an independent window and can be sailed between them without having to recharge the page.

The application is divided into five main pages:

- Login: It is used to register and log in to the application.
- Registration: It is used to register new users in the application.
- Courses: It is used to manage the available courses and reserve courses for students.
- Reservations: It is used to manage courses for students.
- Dashboard: It is used to display the general user information and manage their reservations.

Each page has its own HTML and JavaScript file associated, allowing a clear and maintainable organization of the code.

In summary, this project is a courses management application that allows users to register, create, edit and eliminate courses, as well as book courses for their students.
